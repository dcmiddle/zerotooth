This repo is work in progress.
It is inspired by and makes use of the tutorials in the libsnark project and 
in Howard Wu's separate libsnark-tutorial project.

The end goal is to demonstrate a Hyperledger Sawtooth Transaction Family
using zkSNARKs to hide information in transactions and in global state.

My initial approach was to use gadgetlib2. Encountering a segfault in libsnark
there I switchted to gadgetlib1. I've run up against a separate segfault there.

If you would also like to experience a zero knowledge segfault make sure
you have Docker installed and then enter the following commands
---------------------------------
./build-docker  # builds the docker image for development and running
./run-docker  # drops you into a shell inside the running container

mkdir build 
cd build
cmake ..
make main
./src/main
# enjoy segfault
---------------------------------

WARNING:
I intend to regularly rebase this until I get things working to my satisfaction.
Fork at your own peril.
